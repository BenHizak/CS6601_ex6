    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate the power of probabilistic models. You will build a word recognizer for American Sign Language (ASL) video sequences. In particular, this project employs hidden Markov models (HMM's) to analyze a series of measurements taken from videos of isolated American Sign Language (ASL) signs collected for research. (see the [Isolated Sign Language Recognition Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/asl-signs/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In each video, an ASL signer signs a meaningful sentence. In a typical ASL recognition system, you observe the XY coordinates of the speaker's left hand, right hand, and nose for every frame. The following diagram shows how the positions of the left hand (Red), right hand (Blue), and nose (Green) change over time. Saturation of colors represents time elapsed:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](demo/hands_nose_position.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, for the sake of simplicity, you will only use the Y-coordinates of the right hand and the right thumb to construct your HMM. In Part 1 you will build a one dimensional model, recognizing words based only on a series of right-hand Y coordinates; in Part 2 you will go multidimensional and utilize both the right hand and the right thumb features. At this point, you will have two observed coordinates at each time step (frame) representing right hand & right thumb Y positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The words you will be recognizing are \"ALLIGATOR\", \"NUTS\", and \"SLEEP\". These individual signs can be seen in the sign phrases from our dataset:\n",

    "#### 2. For HMM training, which side of the boundary should we check first while assigning observed sequence values to states?\n",
    "After computing the mean and std for each state, adjust the boundary between the states. Always start from the 1st element at the LEFT side of the boundary. If the LEFT element is closer to the next state, then move the boundary leftward. If the LEFT element should stay at the current state, then check the RIGHT element. This is just done to make sure that everyone gets the same results in the context of the assignment."

    "\n",
    "The goal here will be to use the HMM derived from Part 1a (states, prior probabilities, transition probabilities, and parameters of emission distribution) to build a viterbi trellis.  When provided with an evidence vector (list of observed right-hand Y coordinates), the function will return the most likely sequence of states that generated the evidence and the probabilty of that sequence being correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an evidence vector [38, 37, 35, 32, 35, 13, 36, 41, 41, 31, 32, 34, 34] (last training sequence for \"SLEEP\") should output a sequence ['S1', ... 'S2', ... 'S3']\n",
    "\n",
    "If no sequence can be found, the algorithm should return one of the following tuples:\n",
    "`(None, 0)` (null),  `([], 0)` (empty list) or  `(['A1', 'A1', ... 'A1'],0)` (Or all being the first state of that letter)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No sequence can be found\" means the probability reaches 0 midway. If you find an incomplete sequence with some probability, output that sequence with its probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: **DO NOT** consult any external sources other than the Wikipedia PDF in the assignment. Failure to abide by this requirement will lead to a 0 on the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions to complete:\n",
    "1. `viterbi()`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hint:\n",
    "In order to reconstruct your most-likely path after running Viterbi, you'll need to keep track of a back-pointer at each state, which directs you to that state's most-likely predecessor.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are asked to use the provided function `gaussian_prob` to compute  emission probabilities. Although in real work, you have to convert the probability to log-base in order to prevent digit underflow, in this assignment, we will only test your function against a rather short sequence of observations, so **DO NOT** convert the probability to logarithmic probability, otherwise you will fail the tests on Gradescope.\n",
